# Event Website

My Events Website offers a glimpse into my journey in the dynamic realm of events and hospitality. Drawing from my extensive background, I've contributed my expertise to esteemed companies like WeWork, Hyundai Genesis, and ViacomCBS, orchestrating a spectrum of events. These range from a partnership with a local eatery to creating and managing million-dollar events with high-profile clients.

## Design inspiration

I took my original tech website with its starry, space design, 🌟 and brought the clouds and sun to my events website 🌫️. Night vs. Day!
